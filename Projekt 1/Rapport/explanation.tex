\section{Explanation}

In this section we will explain all of the different attributes, our date set contains, as well as how we came to the different types and whether they are discrete or continues attributes. We will also discuss the subject of data issues e.i. missing and corrupted data.

\subsection{Attributes}

\paragraph{Row} This field is describing the id of the subject. This attribute is \textbf{discrete} and \textbf{nominal}.

\paragraph{SBP} SBP is Systolic blood pressure which is a measurement of the subjects blood pressure, and has the unit mmHg. The desired SBP lies in the range 90-119, but it is plausible to go below or above, but that is when there usually is heart problems.
We came to the type \textbf{interval} because it doesn't originate at zero. Since we came to interval then the attribute most likely would be \textbf{continuous}. ?? (Ikke sikker jeg er enig)

\paragraph{Tobacco} Tobacco is measured as the cumulative consumption in kg, and since that the starting point weight is at 0, it would make the attribute type \textbf{ratio}. The attribute is represented by a float, and since the tobacco is described as real numbers, it is a \textbf{continuous} attribute.

\paragraph{LDL} LDL stands for Low density lipoprotein cholesterol and is measured in mmol/L. The regular LDL numbers lies around 4.9 mmol/L. It is a \textbf{continuous} attribute, with a \textbf{ratio} type since zero is the absence of LDL and is described by real numbers.

\paragraph{Adiposity} Adiposity is a sort of indexing for a persons body mass, where this is taken from the waist. It is a \textbf{continuous} attribute since we have real numbers, and it takes on \textbf{ratio} as type.

\paragraph{Famhist} Family history is the attribute that tells if heart disease is present or absent in the persons family, this also make attribute \textbf{discrete} because it is represented as a set of words in the dataset. The type is \textbf{nominal} because it can either be there or not there.

\paragraph{Type-a} Type-a is a test score that shows how aggressive a persons is. This is a \textbf{discrete} attribute since it is a countable value from 0-100. Because a test score usually is a form of grading system, it would make the type \textbf{ordinal}.

\paragraph{Obesity} Obesity is like adiposity a indexing for a persons body mass, we better know this one as BMI. Where adiposity uses the waist to find the index, obesity uses the height. It is as adiposity a \textbf{continuous} attribute with the \textbf{ratio} type. 0 means the absence of body mass. ??(2 * BMI betyder jo ikke 2 * VÃ¦gt -> ratio?)

\paragraph{Alcohol} Alcohol is measured as the current alcohol consumption, which we believe is measured as pure alcohol litres consumption over a year. Since we have real numbers and infinitely many possible values, it is a \textbf{continuous} attribute, and because 0 l of pure alcohol is a absence of what is measured, the type is \textbf{ratio}.

\paragraph{Age} Age is the age of the subject. It is usually handled as a continues attribute, but in this data set it is treated like a \textbf{discrete} attribute. We have the age in years, meaning we only have the natural numbers. Age has a starting point at 0 which would make it absence of a age and that would make the attribute type \textbf{ratio}.

\paragraph{CHD} CHD stands for coronary heart disease and is a binary attribute that says if the subject has CHD. Since it is binary it makes the attribute \textbf{discrete} and the type would be \textbf{nominal}.

\subsection{Data issues}

As of missing data, we don't really have any corrupted or missing data in any of our data entries, but we do have a single missing data entry at 262. Since it is an entire entry that is missing it will not do any harm to our data models. We will ?? (Der mangler vist noget) ?? (Har vi noget om corrupted data)
