\section{Introduction}
The following report will try to describe how well the data can be clustered using Gaussian Mixture Model and hierarchical clustering. Using these clusters we will try to extract information on whether a person has CHD.

Using Association Mining on our data, we will extract association rules using the apriori algorithm, to say something about when an object is likely to have CHD. We will also look for other strong associations that could explain some of the data.

Finally we will discuss outlier detection using Gaussion Kernel Density, K-Nearest Neighbour density, K-Nearest Neughbour average relative density and distance to Kth Nearest Neighbour. Based on these measures we will evaluate if our dataset contains outliers.
