In the following report, we will be performing regression and classification analysis on our dataset. The dataset used in the report is the same as the one used in Project 1, concerning South Africans in risk of getting CHD - Coronary Heart Disease.

The report will try to cover the aspects of linear regression, with and without feature selection, artificial neural networks, decision trees, logistic regression and K-Nearest Neighbours. The performance of each model will be discussed and compared to eachother in order to measure the correctness and performance.
