\subsection{Comparing regression results}
Comparing the linear regressions misclassification rate, with the artificial neural networks error rate, we get something like this: (Note that fs is: Feature Selection, ANN is "Artificial Neural Network" and the number following ANN defines how many hidden layers are used)
\begin{table}[!h]
\begin{longtable}{lc} \hline
Regression type & error in \% \\ \hline
Linear no fs & 35.7 \\
Linear w/ fs & 37.1\\
ANN 5 & 34.4 \\
ANN 10 & 33.3 \\
ANN 25 & 30.3 \\
ANN 50 & 22.1\\ \hline
\end{longtable}
\end{table}
This shows us that using Artificial Neural Networks seems to be performing better at predicting data in our dataset than Linear regression does. However, even though ANN is performing better than Linear regression, the results are still poor.
