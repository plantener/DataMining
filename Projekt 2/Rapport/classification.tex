\section{Classification}
\label{classification}
For our classification, we have worked with Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-nearest neighbours and Artificial Neural Network. All these methods have been applied, where we look at all the attributes of our dataset, where we only look at the attributes with the most importance according to our forward selection section \ref{ForwardSelection}, where we have standardized the data according to find principal components looking at all the principal components, and where we only look at the two most important principal components. Meaning we have given our data as four different types of input for these methods.
