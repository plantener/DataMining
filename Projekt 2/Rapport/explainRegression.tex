\subsection{Regression problem to solve}
We have chosen to solve the regression problem where CHD (coronary heart disease) is predicted given some other attributes. The reason for choosing CHD is that this is what the data set concerns, and that this is also what we will try to do classification on later.
Even though CHD is a binary attribute, we can do linear regression on it, considering it as a continues variable, where a person predicted to have a CHD of 0.8, is more likely to have CHD than a person with CHD = 0.7
